/*
Problem :
Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, 
"Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
*/

// First Logic : using template literals
function greet(name){
    //your code here
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`
}

console.log(greet("Abid"))
console.log(greet("Juliant"))
console.log(greet("Indraswara"))
